It works in tandem with [symphonyno5.sh](http://github.com/firegoby/symphonyno5.sh.git) for command-line admin of your Symphony project. It includes support for compiling minified production assets from CSS pre-processors (**Less**, **Sass** & **Stylus** support) as well as Javascript, with **Coffeescript** support.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* **HTML5** master.xsl XSLT template based on HTML5Boilerplate\r\n* Works with [symphonyno5.sh](http://github.com/firegoby/symphonyno5.sh.git) for **easy command-line admin**\r\n* `extensions.csv` list for Symphony Extensions - installed as git submodules via [symphonyno5.sh](http://github.com/firegoby/symphonyno5.sh.git)\r\n* Includes the [Production Mode](http://github.com/firegoby/production_mode.git) extension to **automatically serve minified assets when in production mode** (*set through the Symphony CMS Admin*)\r\n* **Split Manifest directory structure** for separate Development & Production environments\r\n* All **stylesheets compile into a single, minified `production-{SHA1hash}.min.css`**\r\n* All **javascripts compiled into a single, minified `production-{SHA1hash}.min.js`**\r\n* **Font Awesome** (font-based icons) \r\n* **html5doctor.com CSS Reset** (with `box-sizing: border-box` for all elements)\r\n* Repsonsive Design Test Page with common breakpoints (/responsive.html)\r\n\r\n## Contents\r\n\r\n* [**Installation**](#installation)\r\n* [**Usage**](#usage)\r\n  * [CSS Compilation](#css-compilation)\r\n  * [Concatenate & Minify Javascript for Production](#concatenate--minify-javascript-for-production)\r\n  * [Frequently Asked Questions](#frequently-asked-questions)\r\n* [**Changelog**](#changelog)\r\n* [**Symphony CMS Overview**](#symphony-cms-overview)\r\n  * [Symphony Server Requirements](#symphony-server-requirements)\r\n* [**Licenses**](#licenses)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n1. Install [symphonyno5.sh](http://github.com/firegoby/symphonyno5.sh.git) to your $PATH\r\n2. Setup Apache (or equivalent) web server to serve your domain\r\n3. Setup a MySQL database (recommend charset=`utf-8`, collate=`utf8_unicode_ci`)\r\n4. Setup a MySQL user for the database, taking note of connection details\r\n4. `symphonyno5.sh new projectname` and follow the instructions\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### CSS Compilation\r\n\r\n`workspace/styles/main.less` is the master stylesheet. Add all other stylesheets as `@import` directives within that files for easy concatenation of all stylesheets into a single production file.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use **Sass** or **Stylus** instead just replace the `main.less` with `main.sass`, `main.scss` or `main.styl` and make sure the command-line compiler for your chosen CSS pre-processor is available to your `$PATH`.\r\n\r\n1. `symphonyno5 compile styles`\r\n2. In Symphony admin **Preferences** enable **Production Mode**\r\n\r\n### Concatenate & Minify Javascript for Production\r\n\r\n1. Add any javascripts between the `<!-- CONCAT_JS_LIST_START/END -->` comments near the footer of `master.xsl`\r\n2. `symphonyno5 compile scripts`\r\n3. In Symphony admin **Preferences** enable **Production Mode**\r\n\r\n#### Note\r\n\r\nThe un-minified concatenated `production.js` file is left so that it can be examined in case of errors post-concatenation. If you're concerned about public access to the un-minified version of your scripts delete it before deployment, or block it in `.htaccess` or equivalent.\r\n\r\n### Frequently Asked Questions\r\n\r\n1. **I don't want to use Coffeescript! What do I do?**\r\n\r\n   Simply delete `workspace/scripts/main.coffee` and write your javascript in `workspace/scripts/main.js` instead. The `symphonyno5 compile scripts` command will continue to work fine.\r\n\r\n2. **I don't want to use Less CSS! What do I do?**\r\n\r\n   Just delete the .less files in `workspace` styles and replace with your own `main.css`. If you want to use Sass or Stylus instead simply replace `main.less` with `main.sass`, `main.scss`, or `main.styl`. \r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n* 0.7.0 - 24 Nov 12 -\r\n  * Add automated `production-{SHA1hash}.min.ext` styles and scripts\r\n  * Updates to match improvements in [SymphonyNo5.sh](http://github.com/firegoby/symphonyno5.sh.git)\r\n  * Remove legacy Ant build script\r\n  * Remove custom Less CSS code, make CSS PreProcessor support agnostic\r\n  * Remove Bootstrap integration\r\n  * Remove hana+nils XSLT Kit for Symphony\r\n  * Remove use-case specific meta tags\r\n* 0.6.1 -
