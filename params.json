Setup Apache & MySQL\r\n2. Clone Symphony No.5 repository\r\n3. Install Symphony CMS\r\n\r\n### Detailed Installation Instructions\r\n\r\n1. Setup Apache to serve your domain\r\n  * PHP 5.2 or above (PHP 5.3 recommended)\r\n  * PHP's LibXML module, with the XSLT extension enabled (--with-xsl)\r\n  * Apache's mod_rewrite module or equivalent - see .htaccess for details\r\n\r\n2. Setup your MySQL database, recommend charset=`utf8`, collate=`utf8_unicode_ci`\r\n\r\n3. Setup a MySQL user for database, take note of connection details\r\n\r\n4. Clone Symphony No.5 repository\r\n\r\n    `git clone git://github.com/firegoby/symphonyno5.git projectname`  \r\n\r\n5. cd to the project root\r\n\r\n    `cd projectname`\r\n\r\n6. init and update the git submodules\r\n\r\n    `git submodule update --init`\r\n\r\n7. Temporarily loosen file permissions for install\r\n\r\n    `chmod -R 777 .`\r\n\r\n8. Visit the install directory on the project domain with browser\r\n\r\n    `open http://projectname.com/install`\r\n\r\n9. Login to Symphony CMS Admin\r\n\r\n    `open http://projectname.com/symphony`\r\n\r\n10. Agree to deletion of installation files (no longer needed)\r\n\r\n11. Set all directories under project root dir to 770 (user & group all, public none)\r\n\r\n    `find . -type d -exec chmod 770 {} \\;`\r\n\r\n    **The exact permissions needed will depend on your server configuration**, possibly `755` (owner all, group & public read and execute)\r\n\r\n12. Set all files to 660 (user & group read-write, public none)\r\n\r\n    `find . -type f -exec chmod 660 {} \\;`\r\n\r\n    Files don't need the executable flag set, alternative permissions could be `644` (owner read/write, group & public read)\r\n\r\n13. Switch to bootstrap submodule dir\r\n\r\n    `cd workspace/bootstrap`\r\n\r\n14. Discard any changes made by above commands\r\n\r\n    `git checkout -- .`\r\n\r\n15. Checkout the bootstrap version to use (e.g. 2.1.0-wip)\r\n\r\n    `git checkout 2.1.0-wip`\r\n\r\n16. Commit bootstrap version to git\r\n\r\n    `cd ../..`\r\n\r\n    `git add workspace/bootstrap`\r\n\r\n    `git commit -m \"Setting Bootstrap to 2.1.0.-wip\"`\r\n\r\n17. Post installation cleanup (`git status` should show installation files deleted)\r\n\r\n    `git add -u .`\r\n\r\n    `git commit -m \"Removing installation files\"`\r\n\r\n18. Remove Symphony No.5 git remote, no longer needed\r\n\r\n    `git remote rm origin`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Frequently Asked Questions\r\n\r\n1. How do I enable Bootstrap?\r\n\r\n> Uncomment the @import line(s) in `workspace/styles/main.less` and also any javascript imports you need in the end of `workspace/utilities/master.xsl`. If you're using the Ant build script to produce concatenated and minified javascript for production you'll also want to uncomment the relevant javascripts in the build script `workspace/scripts/build/build.xml`.\r\n\r\n2. I don't want Bootstrap! What do I do?\r\n\r\n> As of version 0.5.2 Bootstrap is disabled by default so you don't need to do anything. If you want to remove all the Bootstrap files then remove the `workspace/bootstrap` git submodule, and delete the references to the javascripts in `workspace/utilities/master.xsl` and in the Ant build script `workspace/scripts/build/build.xml`.\r\n\r\n3. I don't want to use Coffeescript! What do I do?\r\n\r\n> Simply delete `workspace/scripts/main.coffee` and write your javascript in `workspace/scripts/main.js` instead. The Ant build script (`workspace/scripts/build`) will continue to work fine.\r\n\r\n4. I don't want to use Less CSS! What do I do?\r\n\r\n> Just delete the .less files (or all the files in `workspace/styles`) and replace with your plain CSS, SASS, Stylus or whatever stylesheets instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Less CSS Compilation\r\n\r\n`workspace/styles/main.less` is the master stylesheet. Add all other stylesheets as `@import` directives within that files for easy concatenation of all stylesheets into a single production file. If you want to minify the resulting CSS file do so in your LESS compiler, or from the command line (using the official `lessc` compiler available via NPM)\r\n    `lessc --compress workspace/styles/main.less > workspace/styles/main.css`\r\n\r\n### Ant Build Script - Concatenate & Minify Javascript for Production\r\n\r\n1. Add all javascripts files (in the order you want them referenced) to `workspace/scripts/build.xml`. If using CoffeeScript add the filename with a `.js` extension, all CoffeeScript files will be compiled before minification and concatenation.\r\n2. `cd workspace/scripts/build`\r\n3. `ant`\r\n4. Alter `master.xsl` to point to the production file `/workspace/scripts/production.min.js`.\r\n\r\n#### Notes\r\n\r\nThe un-minified concatenated `production.js` file is left so that it can be examined in case of errors post-concatenation. If you're concerned about public access to the un-minified version of your scripts delete it before deployment, or block it in `.htaccess` or equivalent.\r\n\r\n## Symphony CMS Overview\r\n\r\nSymphony is a `PHP` & `MySQL` based CMS that utilises `XML` and `XSLT` as its core technologies. \r\n\r\n* Visit the website at <http://getsymphony.com/>\r\n* Github Repository: <http://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/>\r\n\r\n### Symphony Server Requirements\r\n\r\n- PHP 5.2 or above\r\n- PHP's LibXML module, with the XSLT extension enabled (--with-xsl)\r\n- MySQL 4.1 or above\r\n- An Apache or Litespeed webserver\r\n- Apache's mod_rewrite module or equivalent\r\n\r\n## Licenses\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the LICENSE.* files in the root directory.\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
